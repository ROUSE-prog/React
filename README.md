### Adopt A Pet
Practicing using React Router to add client-side routing to a React Application. Specifically, I built a pet adoption website that allows users to view all the adoptable pets of a particular species and view the profiles of specific adoptable pets.

### Bug Tracker

### Crumb
The app is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, which allows businesses to manage their interactions with customers. The app is built using React and Node.js with Express, and it uses Firebase to store customer data. The app provides a dashboard for an overview of the customer data, a customer list for managing individual customers, and individual customer pages for viewing and editing customer information. The app also provides APIs for communicating between the front-end and back-end of the app, allowing for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the customer data. The app can be hosted on a hosting service like AWS, allowing businesses to access the CRM system from anywhere with an internet connection.

### Expense Tracker
An expense tracking application with data visualization - developed using React, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Victory.

### Falling Simulation

### MediaStream
A media streaming application with media upload and stream features - developed using React, Node, Express, and MongoDB.

### Movie Roulette
A fun and engaging React app game that challenges users to test their movie knowledge based on a randomly generated letter. When the game starts, the app displays a random letter, and the user is prompted to submit a movie title that starts with the given letter.

### Paper To-do List
The classic Todos Tracker as a Progressive Web App. Built using React, Redux, leveraging styled-components, PaperCSS, Service Worker tools. Data is retained using localStorage.
