### Adopt A Pet (In progress)
Practicing using React Router to add client-side routing to a React Application. Specifically, I built a pet adoption website that allows users to view all the adoptable pets of a particular species and view the profiles of specific adoptable pets.

### Crumb(Dev state)
The app is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, which allows businesses to manage their interactions with customers. The app is built using React and Node.js with Express, and it uses Firebase to store customer data. The app provides a dashboard for an overview of the customer data, a customer list for managing individual customers, and individual customer pages for viewing and editing customer information. The app also provides APIs for communicating between the front-end and back-end of the app, allowing for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the customer data. The app can be hosted on a hosting service like AWS, allowing businesses to access the CRM system from anywhere with an internet connection.

### Falling Simulation(In Progress)
