## Movie Roulette!
The app verifies the submitted movie title using the OMDB API to ensure that it's a valid movie and starts with the specified letter. If the submission is correct, the app displays the movie poster, increments the user's score, and updates the submission history. The submission history prevents users from reusing movie titles during the game. The game continues with new random letters, allowing users to test their knowledge and accumulate points.
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
